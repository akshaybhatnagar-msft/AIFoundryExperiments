Before you run the code, login to azure by running the command below

az login --use-device-code

Once logged in, Azure AI Foundry client can use your az credentials to get access to all the models you have access to and enable you to run them without API Keys.

In case you do not have az installed, follow the instructions here -

curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
